# Digital Music Store Data Analysis
## Business Overview
The music industry has undergone a significant transformation with the rise of digital music platforms. These platforms generate vast amounts of data related to customer preferences, purchase behaviors, and music trends. Analyzing this data can provide valuable insights for music stores to enhance customer experience, optimize sales strategies, and identify emerging trends in the music industry.

In this project, we will explore the data collected from a digital music store to identify patterns and solve various business problems. By leveraging SQL queries, we aim to turn raw data into meaningful insights that can drive business decisions and improve operational efficiency.

## Why Data Analysis in Music Stores?
Data analysis plays a crucial role in the digital music industry by enabling businesses to:

- Understand customer preferences and behavior.
- Optimize pricing and promotional strategies.
- Identify top-performing artists and genres.
- Improve inventory management and sales forecasting.

## Problems Addressed
The project will tackle several key challenges faced by digital music stores, including:

1. **Customer and Sales Analytics**: Understanding customer spending habits and identifying top customers.
2. **Genre and Artist Analysis**: Analyzing popular genres and artists to tailor marketing efforts.
3. **Revenue Optimization**: Identifying cities and countries with the highest sales to focus promotional efforts.
   
## Aim
To explore the digital music store data and identify key trends and opportunities for growth.

## Data Description
The dataset includes information on 98,230 customers with 73 unique features related to customer demographics, personal information, and purchasing history.

## Tech Stack
